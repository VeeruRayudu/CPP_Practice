Changes made in Main.cpp:
- Manual allocation with new and delete[] for DTC* array, Replaced with std::array<std::unique_ptr<DTC>, 3> for automatic memory cleanup.
- Indexed for loop with i, Used range-based for loop with external index counter for improved readability.
- Explicit delete and nullptr assignment for each object and array =is changed to unique_ptr handles destruction automatically.
- Improved formatting

Sensor.h
-->- Marked Sensor() as default.
- Deleted setState(const State&) to enforce rvalue-only updates.
- Added const qualifiers to getters.
- Removed redundant comments and grouped logically.

 Sensor.cpp
- Used std::move(type) in constructor to avoid unnecessary string copies.
- Moved toString(State) into an anonymous namespace to restrict linkage.

 main.cpp
- Replaced raw array with std::array<Sensor, 3> for safety and clarity.
- Used uniform initialization ({}) for object construction.
- Used auto and const auto& in loops for cleaner syntax.
- Added null check in logSensorByPtr() for safety.
- Marked lambda and loop variables as const where applicable.

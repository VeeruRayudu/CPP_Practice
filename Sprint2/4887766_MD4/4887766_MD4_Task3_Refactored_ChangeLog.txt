signalBuffer.h
-->- Deleted copy constructor and assignment operator to enforce move-only semantics.
- Added const qualifiers to getters and print().

 SignalBuffer.cpp
- Used std::move(source) in constructor to avoid unnecessary string copies.
- Moved toString(Status) into an anonymous namespace.
- Added null check in logByPtr() for safety.

 main.cpp
- Replaced raw array with std::array<SignalBuffer, 5> for safety and clarity.
- Used uniform initialization ({}) for object construction.
- Used auto and const auto& in loops for cleaner syntax.
- Grouped output sections with clear headers.
- Used std::move() in filter loop to demonstrate move semantics.

Changes Made for:
-->Vehicle.h:
    -  Added explicit to all constructors to prevent implicit conversions.
    -  Used const std::string& instead of std::string to avoid unnecessary copies.
    - Marked ElectricCar::runDiagnostics() as final override to prevent further overrides.

-->Vehicle.cpp
    - Removed redundant semicolons after constructor definitions.
    - Improved formatting and spacing for readability.
    - Grouped class implementations with clear section headers.

-->Main.cpp:
    - Replaced raw array with std::array<Vehicle*, 3> for type safety and clarity.
    - Used range-based for loop for cleaner iteration.
    - Added final std::endl for consistent output formatting

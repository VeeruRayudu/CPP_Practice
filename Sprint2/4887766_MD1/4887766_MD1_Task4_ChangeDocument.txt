Changes made for:
-->safetyFeature.h:
    - Marked all constructors as explicit to prevent unintended implicit conversions.
    - Used const std::string& instead of std::string for constructor parameters to avoid unnecessary copies.
    - Deleted copy constructor using const SafetyFeature& for correctness and clarity.
    - Added virtual ~SafetyFeature() destructor to ensure proper cleanup of derived classes.

-->Main.cpp :
    - Used polymorphic references (SafetyFeature&) to demonstrate correct virtual dispatch.
    - Added labeled output section (Activating Safety Features) for clarity.

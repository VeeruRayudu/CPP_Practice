Changes made for :
-->Vehicle.h:
    - Marked the parameterized constructor as explicit to prevent unintended implicit conversions.
    - Used const std::string& instead of std::string for constructor parameters to avoid unnecessary copies.
    - Added a descriptive comment for the #endif directive (// VEHICLE_H)

-->Main.cpp:
    -  Replaced raw pointer array with std::array<Vehicle*, 3> for type safety and clarity.
    - Used range-based for loop for cleaner iteration.
    - Added labeled output sections (Vehicle Status Report) for clarity.
    - Removed redundant calls to show() before the loop to avoid duplication.

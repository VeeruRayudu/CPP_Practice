- Renamed lambda parameters: Changed generic names like y, z, a, b to more descriptive ones like val to avoid shadowing and improve clarity.
- Added output labels: Each std::cout line now includes a label so you can easily identify which lambda produced which result.
- Each lambda is clearly labeled with its capture strategy (by value, by reference, etc.)
- Removed #include <array> since it wasn't used.
